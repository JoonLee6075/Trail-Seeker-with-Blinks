Bring as many blinks as you can (at least 12) and a friend to play trail seeker, a fun strategy game where the predator's goal is to try to catch the prey in as few turns as possible.

## **Game Instructions**

### **Setup**

Setup the blinks in a formation like the ones shown below. The arrangements shown below is used with 15-18 blinks but formations like these (plenty of lateral and vertical movement area) should be mimicked if more or less than 15 blinks should be used.

Once the board is set up, designate 1 player as the predator and the other as the prey and sit on opposite sides of the board. The predator should double click one one piece close to them until they see that piece turn orange. They are now a fox. The prey should double click until they see their blink turn white. They are now a rabbit. Choose a game mode listed in the win condition and start playing!

### Gameplay

Alternate turns starting with the player who is the rabbit. Every time the rabbit player takes a turn, the fox player closes their eyes. After, the fox player takes their turn but the rabbit player gets to spectate their turn.

## Rabbit Turn

Pros & Cons

**Pro: Spectate how your opponent moves**

**Con: Leave behind a trail, Can only move into grass spaces**

---

- Make sure the fox player has closed their eyes
1. Unhide your rabbit blink if necessary by triple clicking on the space you last ended up on
2. Inspect the board and make a decision on which neighboring space you would like to move to
3. Single click on the rabbit blink and then single click on the neighboring **grass space** you would like to go to
4. triple click where you are now (the spinning white blink) to hide

## Fox Turn

Pros & Cons

**Pro: Can move to any space**

**Con: Can only find the rabbit through following the trail**

---

1. Inspect the board and make a decision on which neighboring space you would like to move to
2. Single click on the fox blink and then single click on the neighboring space you would like to go to
3. Once the fox lands on that new space, you have now taken one turn. Keep track of how many turns you take
4. Close your eyes as the rabbit makes thier turn

**Note: If the rabbit does not have any neighboring grass spaces they can move to, the fox wins and reset using the instructions below**

---

## **Win Condition**

If the predator lands on the rabbit tile, then most of the board  will light up red. Therefore, the predator won. Then click all of the red blinks until they are all green again. You are then able to play the game. If the rabbit does not have any neighboring **grass spaces** it can move to, then the fox wins at that point and remembers how many turns they had taken up until that point. That would become their score

- Game Malfunctioning
    
    In the event of malfunctioning, long press a blink until it turns green. Then recreate the condition or restart the game. 
    

### Turn Competition - Classic

1. Player 1 plays as the predator and takes count of how many turns it took for them to win (catch the prey).
2. Player 2 then does the same attempting to catch the prey in less turns
3. Continue to repeat unless one person catches the prey in less turns than the others

### Betcha' - Free Play

1. Tell your partner "I betcha I can catch you as the predator in x turns or less" or "I betcha I can evade you for at least 5 turns." If you choose to evade, feel free to setup your own starting conditions rather than starting from opposite sides of the board.
2. Try to fufill the bet.
3. If you fulfill the bet, you get one point and if you don't you get zero points
